Fan Chirp Transform F0gram Vamp Plugin
======================================

#### A spectral visualisation plugin using the Fan Chirp transform

This repository contains the Vamp plugin implementation of the Fan
Chirp Transform F0gram, written by Ignacio Irigaray and Martín
Rocamora of the Universidad de la República, Uruguay.

The plugin produces a representation, called an F0gram, which exhibits
the salience of the fundamental frequency of the sound sources in the
audio file. The computation of the F0gram makes use of Fan Chirp
Transform analysis.
